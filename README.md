# CS5821SemesterProject
A Repository to store all of the various work done for my CS5821 Semester Project on Classifying Magic the Gathering Cards into their color identities by their Card artwork using Neural Networks.
## NOTE:
The data set was obtained from Scryfall.com, and is their information, from their bulk data JSON, which is updated frequently. As such, I have provided the exact copy that I used, however it was too large for Github. So it was put in a zip file to compress it. Also, all artwork of Magic the Gathering cards is owned by Wizards of the Coast.
